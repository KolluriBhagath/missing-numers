This Python program finds a single missing number from a sequence of unique integers ranging from 0 to n. The user provides a space-separated list of numbers as input, which is expected to contain all numbers in that range except one. The program calculates the expected total using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers and subtracts the actual sum of the input list. The result is the missing number.
